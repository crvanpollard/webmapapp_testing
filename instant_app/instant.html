<h1>CMP 2021</h1>
<p>A CMP is a systematic process for managing congestion that provides information on transportation system performance. It recommends a range of strategies to minimize congestion and enhance the mobility of people and goods. These multimodal strategies include, but are not limited to, operational improvements, travel demand management, policy approaches, and additions to capacity. The CMP advances the goals of the DVRPC Long-Range Plan and strengthens the connection between the Plan and the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).</p>
<p>The CMP is an ongoing and systematic process that uses performance-based and other CMP objective measures to identify and prioritize congested locations on the regional transportation network, analyzes potential causes, develops multimodal transportation strategies to mitigate congestion, and evaluates the effectiveness of implemented strategies to improve mobility, and enhance safety across the region.</p>
